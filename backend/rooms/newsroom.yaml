  The news room is suspiciously dark. It seems that the Grinch has managed to affect the power supply
  of the bank. The electricity to most rooms and resources is down. Something unexpected has happened.
  You are uncertain because no one can tell you exactly what happened.
  There is only one computer to access the outside world to get updated news. The internet is quite slow.
  Unfortunately, it seems that receiving updates is not possible with this poor network quality. You are
  trying to connect to the internet, and get updated through the different channels. You have only one option:
  launch and connect one of the following applications to ensure you get the recent and most relevant updates
  about the current crisis:

  1) *Twitter* especially after the changes made by Musk to optimize the quality of the platform,
  2) Microsoft *Teams*, or
  3) *Fact 24* system

    You can leave the office with [leave office]. Once you leave the office, you cannot come back.
  teams^fail^internet: |
    Teams shows you personal messages from your colleagues. Yesterday’s message from your manager is still unread.
    You do not feel like reading it now since you expect it to be another task he is assigning to you.

  fact24^success^internet: |
    Fact24 is the relevant system to share updates directly from management and the department heads.
    The system shows that the power is down in the bank. After a few seconds, you get an update that the power
    will be restored in 2 min. You take this opportunity to relax a bit in the news room.

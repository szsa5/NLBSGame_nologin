name: News Room
description: |
  The news room is suspiciously dark. It seems that the Grinch has managed to affect the power supply
  of the bank. The electricity to most rooms and resources is down. Something unexpected has happened.
  You are uncertain because no one can tell you exactly what happened.
  There is only one computer to access the outside world to get updated news. The internet is quite slow.
  Unfortunately, it seems that receiving updates is not possible with this poor network quality. You are
  trying to connect to the internet, and get updated through the different channels. You have only one option:
  launch and connect one of the following applications to ensure you get the recent and most relevant updates
  about the current crisis:

  1) *X* especially after the changes made by Musk to optimize the quality of the platform,
  2) Microsoft *Teams*, or
  3) *Fact24* system

  Make your choice using [look application_name].

  x^fail^internet: |
    X is showing different local and international news and stories. Christmas is the main theme
    of tweets. There are a few tweets about a Grinch planned attack on New York City banks. But no details yet …

  teams^fail^internet: |
    Teams shows you personal messages from your colleagues. Yesterday’s message from your manager 
    is still unread. You do not feel like reading it now, since you expect it to be another task he is 
    assigning to you.

  fact24^success^internet: |
    Fact24 is the relevant system to share updates directly from management and the department heads. 
    The system shows that the power is down throughout the bank. After a few seconds, you get an update
    that the power will be restored within 2 min. You take this opportunity to relax in the news room.

    A screen mounted on the wall in the newsroom lights up, displaying the word 'Crisis!'.
    You find yourself in a bustling company headquarters amidst a crisis. People are rushing around, 
    trying to figure out the best course of action. The CEO walks into the room with different team members. 
    The atmosphere is tense, and the urgency in the air is tangible. The CEO, a formidable figure, turns to you.
    With a firm tone, the CEO start talking to you..

    CEO: "We're in the midst of a crisis, and time is not our ally. We need a crisis management team, and we need it now. Who do you propose should be included in this team?"
    The room falls silent, all eyes on you. The weight of the decision rests heavily on your shoulders. How will you respond?

    1) Only senior executives and managers.
    2) A cross-functional representation of employees from different departments.
    3) Only employees with technical expertise in power systems.

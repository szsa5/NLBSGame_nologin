name: Factory 2
description: |
  Along the ceiling of this room are rails that lead to the east.  Heavy chains
  hang from the rails, ready to pick up heavy objects.  A *machine* sitting in
  the middle of the room is humming gently.

  On the west wall, there is a door with a *keypad* next to it.  The door leads
  to a lab.

name: RADAR room
description: |
  You let your eyes adjust to a room that is darker than usual.  This room
  feels like a control center of some kind. There are big screens showing maps
  of the North Pole, and *screens* showing RADAR information.  On the side are
  *schematics* of missiles with piles of books containing technical data.
  Several *posters* on the wall have data plotted on them.

  Hidden on the north wall is a door with a *keypad* next to it. The door leads
  to the server room.
items:
  screens: |
    You pause and look at the RADAR screens, hoping to catch a glimpse of
    Santa's sleigh, but then remember Sleigh One is unable to fly as long as the
    COVID missiles are able to shoot it down.
  schematics: |
    The missile schematics confirm what you've seen on the factory floor. They
    have a compartment that can hold different payloads, with dog biscuits
    being one of the possible payloads.
  posters: |
    The data shows different estimated missile trajectories based on fuel
    consumption, payload size and wind factors.
  keypad: |
    The keypad has the standard buttons for entering a pincode. It also
    contains a scanner for special access cards. Type [keypad <pincode>] to use
    a special accesscard here.

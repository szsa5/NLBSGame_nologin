  fridge: |
    The fridge contains some oddly shaped fruit. You are unsure whether the
    fruit has expired or not, since you can not identify it. The smelly
    lunchbox on the bottom shelf has been there for a while though.
  watercooler: |
    The watercooler is housed in a sleek black plastic structure. It dispenses
    both room temperature water as well as cold water.
  sofas: |
    The sofas look comfortable.
  water: |
    You try to determine whether the water is coming from the fridge or the
    watercooler. But something in you tells you that it won't matter unless you
    can stop those COVID missiles from being launched.

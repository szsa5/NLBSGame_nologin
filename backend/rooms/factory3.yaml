name: Factory 3
description: |
  The floor in this room is covered with a metal grate.  You look down through
  it and see large *silos* with liquid in them.  The smell is very distinctive
  and reminds you of jet-fuel.  On the east wall is a long row of metal
  *cabinets*.  On the west wall, there is a door with a *keypad* next to it.
  The door leads to a lab.
items:
  silos: |
    The silos are made of metal and painted in red and white stripes. They
    remind you of candy, but you don't need a lot of convincing that they do
    not contain anything delicious.
  keypad: |
    The keypad has the standard buttons for entering a pincode. It also
    contains a scanner for standard access cards. Type [use accesscard] to use
    an accesscard here.
  cabinets: |
    The cabinets are metallic gray and are covered with name-tags for
    electronic components. The doors of the cabinets are locked.

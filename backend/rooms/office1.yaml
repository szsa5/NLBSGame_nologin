name: Office area 1
description: |
  Several desks are arranged in rows in the most unimaginative way.  One of the
  desks has some printed *documents* on it. A *plant* on another desk hasn't
  seen daylight in months. A nearby trashbin is overflowing with candy
  wrappers.
items:
  documents: |
    You look at the documents and see that they are full of nonsense words.
    Someone wrote "All fun and no play makes Jack a dull boy" over and over on
    the back of them.
  plant: |
    The plant vaguely resembles an abstract interpretation of a Christmas tree,
    with candy wrappers as ornaments.

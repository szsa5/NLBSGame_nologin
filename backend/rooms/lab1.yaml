name: Lab 1
description: |
  Small experimental setups are packed in neat racks and tables on the left
  side of the room. The AC is gently buzzing and a draft proves it's doing its
  job keeping the room cool.  One of the racks has a *radio* with a dial button
  next to it.  Against one of the walls are desks with soldering *equipment*
  and lots of electronics *components* next to that.
items:
  radio: |
    A standard FM radio used to pass the time while working in the lab.
    Anything is better than the constant beeping alarms, right?  Use [tune
    <frequency>] to tune the radio to a certain frequency, for instance tune
    100.1
  equipment: |
    Looks like standard soldering equipment for the most part. All of it seems
    to have been used extensively, a good indicator of an awesome working
    environment.
  components: |
    Rows and rows of drawers with electronics components cover 2 pylons. You
    could spend several days sifting through these.

  It's 13:37 on a Saturday in December.  You're in an undisclosed location on
  the Northpole, just outside a building dug deep into a mountain.  The
  building is suspected to house a COVID missile launching system belonging to
  the Grinch, who has been waging a war against Santa and Whoville for the past
  weeks.  Your mission is to infiltrate the base and shut down the server
  running the missile launch system.

  There is a *guard* waiting by the gate. He looks unamused, seemingly having
  been left behind for weeks in the cold. You feel his pain.

  Look at the guard, with [look guard], to get their attention.

    The guard looks back at you and straightens up.
        'This is a restricted area! Identify yourself!', he shouts.
    You come closer
        'I have been ordered by the Grinch to do some maintenance', you lie.
    The guard quickly judges whether you are naughty or nice and says:
        'OK, I believe you. Let me make you an access badge. What is your name?'
    You can tell the guard your name with [my name is <name>]

  You are home. You head to the kitchen. The kitchen area looks neat and tidy. One table has nothing but
  a microwave on it. A note on the fridge says “Stay home - Stay safe”. The coffee machine is softly
  humming away in the corner. You still need to do some work on the personal loan reports. You feel lazy
  and look at the comfy sofa. But your computer can be plugged to the power at the Kitchen table.
  You look at the table where you can work on your *computer* and read the files digitally, or you
  look at the shared *printer* that could give you printed copies of the confidential reports and move
  to the sofa. Alternatively, you wonder if you can use your personal *iPad* to read the files on the sofa.

    having a warm cup of coffee.

    Printing confidential documents is not allowed in such printers and particularly
    the ones not password-protected. Try something else.

    Using the iPad is good to read files, but using a personal

  You are home. You head to the kitchen. The kitchen area looks neat and tidy. One table has nothing but
  a microwave on it. A note on the fridge says “Stay home - Stay safe”. The coffee machine is softly
  humming away in the corner. You still need to do some work on the personal loan reports. You feel lazy
  and look at the comfy sofa. But your computer can only be plugged to the power at the kitchen table.
  You look at the table where you can work on your *computer* and read the files digitally, and you
  look at the shared *printer* that could give you printed copies of the confidential reports to be able to
  read them on the sofa. Alternatively, you wonder if you can use your personal *iPad* to read the files on the sofa.

  You can explore the options by looking at different items, and then [select device] to work
  from home without violating the bank's policies.

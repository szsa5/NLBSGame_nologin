description: |
  Desks and cubicles and more of the same. Someone left
  their *jacket* hanging on a coat rack in the middle of the area.
  While the computers on most desks have been shut down, one
  *computer* is still powered on, beeping every so often.
  The desk on which the computer rests also has a landline
  *phoneset* with the horn off the hook.
items:
  computer: |
    The computer appears to be stuck in a loop, rebooting once
    in a while after a blue screen.
  phoneset: |
    A computer voice in the phone repeats the same message over and over: 
      "All our operators are currently occupied. Your call is very
      important to us. You are 10209725th in line"
  jacket: |
    The jacket is green and looks like it would protect well against the
    extreme weather conditions on the North Pole.

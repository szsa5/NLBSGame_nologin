name: Grinch's office
description: |
  A paper bag with *coal* sits on a wooden desk in the center of the room.
  A red Santa suit hangs off of a coat rack on the wall. Next to the suit
  are a pair of red gloves, with a *hole* in one of the fingers.
  Behind the desk is a big advent calendar with 25 opened doors.

  In a hidden corner, a white plastic door hides away a *switchboard*.
items:
  coal: |
    You take a piece of coal to take a closer look. There is nothing special about it.
  hole: |
    Seeing the hole confirms your suspicions that the person in the videos was indeed the
    Grinch dressed as Santa.
  switchboard: |
    (You can also use "l sw" as an abbreviation)
    The switchboard has a 4x4 grid of switches, but it is unclear what they are for.
    Use [toggle <switch>] or [t <switch>] to toggle a switch. For instance, [toggle A1]

name: Entrance
description: |
  The *doormat* under your feet is covered in snow and dirt.  It’s already
  getting dark outside and you can’t see anything through the windows but your
  own tired *reflection*.   On one side of the room is a sofa with a coffee
  table and some *magazines* on top dating back to the 1980s.  In the distance
  you see some abandoned desks.
  
items:
  doormat: |
    It looks like a fairly standard brown doormat with a big print of some
    paws.  The bottom reads: "Go Away!"
  reflection: |
    You stare into your own gaze like a stranger from across the room.  "Hello,
    myself from the past", you say to your own reflection, cleverly observing
    that you are aware of the fraction of a millisecond that it took the light
    to reflect off of the window back into your eyes. You chuckle and your
    reflection chuckles back.
  magazines: |
    One magazine shows a younger Bill Gates in front of an old IBM XT computer,
    while another offers a complete Spectrum business computer system for just
    900GBP.

  The reception hall is quite spacious. Not many people are around today. It is quiet and you can
  only hear a watercooler making bubbling sounds in the corner. To the side there’s an open area
  with tables and sofas for employee to meet their visitors. However, you are in a rush, there is
  no time to waste. You are on a mission to ensure that the bank and all its assets are protected
  against the Grinch’s attempts!

  You are a trader and eager to head to the trading room and execute your daily tasks.

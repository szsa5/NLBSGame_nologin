  This room feels like a control center of some kind. There are different monitors showing different
  applications. One big monitor shows a running *script*. A dim lamp swings gently from the high ceiling
  illuminating a wall with several framed pictures of employees at social events. This reminds you of fun

  to sign a document to receive your badge. You can collect it with [collect badge].

    The script is monitoring the number of attacks launched around the world. On average,
    every 11 seconds, the script shows a new cybersecurity attack. This is such a scary fact to read!
    This makes you realize the real value of complying with security measures.

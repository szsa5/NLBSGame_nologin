name: Mail room
description: |
  The walls of the mail room are covered in *cut-outs* from The Daily Who
  newspaper.  Thereâ€™s an oak colored storage area and mail *lockers* with
  letters and fading tags with almost indecipherable names. A table hosts an
  assortment of colored pens, pencils and paperclips. Next to a pair of
  scissors is a roll of stamps.  On the floor in the corner are several empty
  cardboard boxes and some unassembled cardboard boxes with a role of brown
  tape on top.

  cut-outs: |
    All the cut-outs mention the Grinch in one way or another, dating back for
    years.  Marked in red are several sections of text with "LIES!" written
    next to them.
  lockers: |
    Squinting at the name tags, you make out some of the names: "Engineering",
    "Sales", "IT", "Grinch".  Most mailboxes have a bunch of papers in them,
    which looks like a weekly newsletter of some kind.  The Grinch's mailbox 
    is empty and looks like it has never received a letter.

description: |
  Your desk is looking clean and empty. You have left your *jacket* hanging on a coat rack at the corner.
  Your computer has shutdown after updating the operating system and the antivirus. You turn it on
  feeling happy with the security updates. You start by looking at your *email*.

items:
  email: |
    You have two unread emails. The first one is a communication email to all employees urging everyone
    to act vigilantly. If you notice anything suspicious, you should report to IT Security immediately.

    This makes you keen on going around to check that there are no security violations.

    Use [read latest] to read the latest email.
  jacket: |
    Your jacket is hanging where you left it. No one seems to have touched it. You leave your jacket as
    it is since you are focused on observing security measures to try and prevent the Grinch from succeeding
    with his attack.

  This room looks like a disaster. Computers, antennas, cables, some *device*,
  circuit boards... are spread out all over the place as if a hurricane had a
  crazy day. Something you immediately recognize as a Christmas cheer
  *meter* lies on a shelf. With a room like this, you wonder why there is a
  need for a recreation room.
items:
  device: |
    It's a white metal box with some wires sticking out.  Judging by the
    attached antenna, it must be a transmitter of some kind. The device is
    plugged into a power socket.
  meter: |
    Looks like this device was stolen from Whoville. It has "property of
    Elizabeth Hula-hoo-Who" written at the bottom. You point it at yourself, a
    control-value for maximum Christmas cheer, but the meter reads zero. If the
    meter ever worked, it no longer does.

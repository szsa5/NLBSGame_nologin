  There are several cubicles in this area. One of the cubicles has seven office
  chairs in them. In another cubicle you find an unlocked computer with an open
  browser window. The browser window displays a *website*.  At the end of the
  row of cubicles, you find the remnants of what was probably a *printer*.

    It looks like someone, in a fit of rage, used a blunt object
    to destroy this popular-brand printer. You sympathize.

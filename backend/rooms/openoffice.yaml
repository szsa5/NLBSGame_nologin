  Several desks are arranged around a series of whiteboards. All desks have
  fancy-looking computers on them. One of the computers seems to be running a
  *simulation* of some kind. A few printed papers are laying around the computer in a *pile*.
  There are some colorful motivational posters hanging on the walls.

    You squint at the screen. It reads "Knock, knock, Neo."
  pile: |
    The first paper in the pile shows personal data about a few customers and their account balances.
    There is a “Confidential” label on the paper. You can leave the paper with [leave pile]
    or dispose of the pile with [delete pile] to then leave a clean desk behind.

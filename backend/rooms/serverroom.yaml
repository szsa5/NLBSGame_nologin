name: Server room
description: |
  There are several servers here, placed on makeshift tables.  The air buzzes
  from the server fans in the narrow room.  It feels hot and stuffy, and the
  white walls gives it a claustrophobic vibe.  One particular *server* draws
  your attention, it has "Launch control" written on it.  The server seems
  hardwired into a datarack.  Something tells you that simply shutting down the
  power will trigger the launch system, so you decide to take it safe by
  performing a graceful system shutdown.

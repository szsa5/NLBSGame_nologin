name: Storage room 2
description: |
  The room is filled with several storage racks.  The shelves on the racks have
  *bags* and bags of dog biscuits stacked on top of them. One of the bags has
  been ripped open, with some *biscuits* pouring onto a shelf. You wonder if an
  employee was starving so badly that... no, you don't want to go there.

items:
  bags: |
    On the side of one of the bags you read: not for human consumption.
  biscuits: |
    You smell one of the biscuits. Doesn't smell too bad. But you know in your
    heart that they are not meant for you.

name: Security office
description: |
  You stumble into the security office and wake the security guard
  who was taking a nap behind his desk.
    "I was just resting my eyes!" he exclaims while getting to his feet
    "Wait a second, I don't recognize you! Who are you?"
  Looking around the office, you see several pictures of people you
  recognize as fellow spies and realize you are in trouble.
  You point at your access badge, hoping it will be enough to convince
  the security guard.
    "I don't believe you, I'm calling my boss," the guard says. 
  He pushes a big red button and the door behind you locks. On
  a *computer* screen the head of security answers the videocall
  and after a short explanation by the security guard, they
  start to question you.

  It's going to take some social engineering to convince this person
  that you belong here.

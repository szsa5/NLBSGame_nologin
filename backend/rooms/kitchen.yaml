name: Kitchen
description: |
  The kitchen area looks unusually neat and tidy. One table has nothing but
  *microwaves* on it.  The dishwashers are loaded with an abnormal amount of
  *cutlery*.  A note says “Stay home - Stay safe”.  The coffee machines are
  softly humming away in the corner. A *fridge* next to the dishwasher has a
  *postit* note on it. 

items:
  fridge: |
    The fridge is surprisingly clean as well, not even an empty lunchbox
    or expired bottle of milk!
  postit: |
    The post-it note reads:

        "To whomever accidentally took my lasagna, I hope you enjoyed it.
        I would love to get your feedback, since it's the first time I
        cooked it completely from scratch"
  cutlery: |
    There are all kinds of cutlery ranging from small to large, from different
    brands and different designs. Oddly, there is not a spoon in sight.
  microwaves: |
    There are 4 microwave ovens here, all different brands. It amuses you that
    none of the builtin clocks show an accurate time, subtly offering social
    commentary on the fast-paced nature of today's corporate life: not even
    devices built to keep track of time can keep up with life, while their
    human slaves are too busy to accurately adjust the very metronomes that
    control their lives.

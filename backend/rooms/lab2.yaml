name: Lab 2
description: |
  The air smells stale and dust swirls as in a long forgotten tomb. A dim lamp
  swings gently from the high ceiling illuminating a staircase leading up into
  the void. Across the room the test *chamber* door stands slightly ajar. On
  the wall are several framed pictures of employees at social events. They
  remind you of days gone past, before pandemics and lockdowns, when
  socializing was not just possible but encouraged. Cramped with equipment, the
  table along the wall leads the eye to a high voltage *sign*: DANGER.
items:
  chamber: |
    The chamber is covered with triangularly shaped pieces of foam. You
    consider going inside and singing one of your favorite songs out loud.
    Maybe another time...
  sign: |
    The sign is triangular in shape, showing a black lightning streaking across
    a yellow background. Even though the sign says "DANGER" underneath, you
    ponder whether touching it would be a good idea. You can touch the sign
    with [touch sign].

name: Admin Office
description: |
  There are several cubicles in this area. One of the cubicles has two office
  chairs. In another cubicle you find an unlocked computer with an open
  program window. There is a *post-it* on the computer.  On the screen there are two buttons,
  one to access the *program* and the other play a *screensaver*.

items:
  post-it: |
    The post-it looks a bit old. There are only two words written
    on it ‘admin/admin’. ‘What could this mean?’, you wonder!
  program: |
    The program prompts you with a login window. The username ‘admin’ has been filled in.
    If you were the Grinch, you would have searched for the password or guessed it …
    Test a password using [test <password>] where <password> is a value you believe is the admin password.
  screensaver: |
    A colorful Christmas animation plays. You are affected by seeing this, and more intent on preventing
    the Grinch from succeeding.

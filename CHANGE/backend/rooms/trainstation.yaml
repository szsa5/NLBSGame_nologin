name: New York Train

  You felt tired and worried about what the impact of the attack on your home.
  You teleported to NY train station. You were lucky to catch a train going home directly.
  The day has been quite stressful. The Grinchâ€™s threatening attack is making you
  worried whether you will be able to enjoy and others a merry Christmas or not.
  You want to continue checking on your work and whether the bank applications are still
  working properly. You remember that you should access the loans applications.
  You launch the app and start looking at the reports of individual loans.
  At the same time, you are wondering whether it is safe to navigate such data on the train.
  The reports include personal and financial data. Thus, the data is confidential.
  You are tired and have one thought only:

  1 - Given the attack threat, it is important to view reports on the train
  2 - Confidential data cannot be accessed in public spaces
  3 - The Grinch has eyes everywhere and there is no point in being discreet or worried, since he can access any data at any time

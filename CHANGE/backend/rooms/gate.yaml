  It's 08:10 on a Wednesday in December. The Grinch has planned a set of attacks against New York City,
  and particularly banks to deprive people from accessing their money, and therefore preventing parents
  from buying presents to their kids. This is The Grinch’s new master plan to ruin Santa’s reputation
  and Christmas for everyone.

  The Grinch has planned some attacks that are not entirely known. He is assuming that the level of bank
  cybersecurity is low, and he could infiltrate the systems easily, and cause chaos.

  Your mission is to ensure your tasks are carried out carefully, avoiding any attacks launched against
  NordLB. If you detect anything abnormal, you know what to do …

  You have just arrived at the gate. In the rush, you have forgotten your access badge.
  There is a *guard* waiting by the gate. He looks unamused, seemingly having
  been alone in the cold. You feel his pain…
  You say ‘Good morning.’ ‘Morning’, he replies back.
  Realizing that the guard does not want to chat, you decide:

  1 - Proceed and try and enter the bank [enter bank])
  2 - Identify yourself and ask for a temporary access badge [look guard], to get their attention.

    The guard looks back at you and straightens up.
        'This is a restricted area and not everyone is allowed to enter!  Identify yourself!', he shouts.
    You come closer
        'I work here but I have forgotten my access badge' you say.
    The guard quickly judges whether you are naughty or nice and says:
        'OK, I believe you. Let me make you an access badge. What is your name?'
    You can tell the guard your name with [my name is <name>]
